## Course 3 - Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming

## Assignnment 2 - Clustering

Similar to the course assignment, the files have the following format:

### clustering1 - Explicit Edges

---

\[number\_of\_nodes\]

\[edge 1 node 1\] \[edge 1 node 2\] \[edge 1 cost\]

\[edge 2 node 1\] \[edge 2 node 2\] \[edge 2 cost\]

...

### clustering2 - Implicit Edges

---

\[# of nodes\] \[# of bits for each node's label\]

\[first bit of node 1\] ... \[last bit of node 1\]

\[first bit of node 2\] ... \[last bit of node 2\]

...
