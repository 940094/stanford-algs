## Overview

These are some example input files that I have made for Stanford's Coursera
specialization [_Learn To Think Like A Computer Scientist_]
(https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)

## Intention

These files are intended to be used as a supplement to the above course.
I do not claim ownership of any of the intellectual property of the
Coursera course.

In order to comply with the [Coursera Honor Code]
(https://www.google.com/search?q=Coursera+Honor+Code),
please do not share any solutions to the _actual_ assignments from the course.

If you would like to submit useful test cases, please send me a pull request.
