# Contributing to stanford-algs

Thank you for your interest in helping with our mission.

If this is your first time contributing to a GitHub project, fear not. 
When this repository was started, it was one of the first collaborations done 
by the contributors.  Using GitHub is really quite easy. 
You don't need to worry about making mistakes or breaking anything. 

The collaborators of this repository are very patient and willing to help you. 
After all, we want *you* to help us.  

## Familiarize yourself with GitHub

GitHub has quite an extensive library of training materials. 
They are all very helpful and easy to understand.

## Getting started

If you want to help make some test cases for the students of stanford-algs, 
here's what you should do:

1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
1. [Fork this repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).
1. [Clone your fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#clone) 
to your local machine.
1. [Look at the issues](https://github.com/beaunus/stanford-algs/issues) for 
this repository. Choose an assignment that needs test cases. 
1. In your local repository, make a branch for your new unconfirmed test files. 
For example, make a branch called "unconfirmedTestCases3.2" 
if you are working on Course 3 Assignment 2.
1. Make some test case files. **Note** that we have yet to decide on an file 
naming convention for test case files. You are welcome to use similar file 
names to existing test cases, or propose your own. 
1. Commit your new files to your *local repository*. 
1. Push your *local branch* to your *GitHub repository*.  
1. [Make a Pull Request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request) 
from your GitHub repository dashboard.

At that point, here's what will happen:
1. Our team will review your files to make sure that they 
*don't violate the Coursera Honor Code*. 
If they do, we'll just let you know. You can make adjustments and re-submit.
1. We will *pull your files* to our repository.
1. Once the files have been confirmed by *multiple users*, they will be merged 
with the master branch.
